This file is in the **Posts** folder in your office suite, but in the **_posts** directory in Github. Look at the file conversion rules in your Cloudstitch project to see how we did that.

You’ll also notice that there is more frontmatter in the Github version of this document than specified in this document! That is also configured in our conversion pipeline: we add the date, set the file name, and set the layout for all posts in the **Posts** directory.
